# Salesforce Helper
**The Productivity Power-House for Salesforce Admins and Architects.**

## 🚀 Mission
Salesforce Helper was developed to eliminate the "administrative friction" inherent in managing complex Salesforce orgs. By bridging the gap between the standard Salesforce UI and the Tooling API, this extension empowers Admins to audit, debug, and navigate metadata with unprecedented speed.

## 🛠 Key Features

### 1. Architect-Style Formula Beautifier
Standard Salesforce formulas often become "walls of text," especially in complex implementations like Apttus or CPQ. 
* **Semantic Indentation:** Automatically reformats nested `IF`, `AND`, and `OR` logic into a branching visual hierarchy.
* **Syntax Highlighting:** Uses high-contrast color coding for functions, strings, and operators to prevent syntax errors before they happen.
* **One-Click Portability:** Clean "Copy" functionality to move formatted logic back into Salesforce instantly.

### 2. Intelligent Field Finder
Stop digging through the Object Manager. 
* **Instant Search:** Filter through hundreds of fields across any object in real-time.
* **Metadata Insight:** View API names and "Custom" status at a glance.
* **Deep Linking:** Jump directly to the specific Field Setup page with a single click.
* **Inspector Integration:** Seamlessly export selected field lists directly into Salesforce Inspector for data queries.

### 3. Flow Versioning Manager
Navigate the history of your automation without leaving your current tab.
* **Version Control:** View all versions, their active status, and last modified dates in a clean, vertical timeline.
* **Direct Access:** Open specific historical versions in the Flow Builder instantly.

## 📈 Impact on Productivity
Salesforce Helper is designed to reduce metadata navigation time by up to 50%, allowing Admins to focus on solving business problems rather than searching for technical details.
